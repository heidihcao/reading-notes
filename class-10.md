- Hoisting: Taking all of the variables and functions and hoisting them to the top of the execution context.
- Each execution context also creates its own variables object.
- console.info()
- console.warn()
- console.error()
- Conditional Breakpoints: Add conditional breakpoint in Sources
- try{} TRY TO EXECUTE THIS CODE
- catch(exception){} IF THERES AN EXCEPTION RUN THIS CODE
- finally{} THIS ALWAYS GETS EXECUTED
- throw new Error('message'); CREATE YOUR OWN ERROR
