## growth mindset is: 
- it is a mindset that believes in trial and error, and that progress and improvement can be earned through hard work and attempts rather than pre-determined by talent or hard-wired traits.

### growth mindset to *me* is:
1. have patience in the time it takes to grow
1. have resilience in the amount of failed attempts I might have to experience
1. be level-headed and not be tempted to compare with peers
