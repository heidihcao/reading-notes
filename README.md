## growth mindset is: 
- it is a mindset that believes in trial and error, and that progress and improvement can be earned through hard work and attempts rather than pre-determined by talent or hard-wired traits.

### growth mindset to *me* is:
1. have patience in the time it takes to grow
1. have resilience in the amount of failed attempts I might have to experience
1. be level-headed and not be tempted to compare with peers

------------ | -------------
Inline code | I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead
Task Lists | [x] this is a complete item and - [ ] this is an incomplete item
Strikethrough | wrap with two tildes
