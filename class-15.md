### Takeaway points ### 

1. The "who" on the team doesn't matter as much as we thought
   - There was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference.
2. Open and collaborative work environment is the key to performance
   - As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well. 
   - But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined.
