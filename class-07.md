> Domain Modeling
1. https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling
2. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
3. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
4. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
5. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
6. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
7. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

> HTML: Tables (pp.126-145)

2. <tr>: start of each row
3. <td>: each cell of a table
4. <th> just like <td> but its purpose is to represent the heading for a column or row.
5. Long tables: <thead> <tbody> <tfoot>
